- Nair is fast AND big, pick a struggle
- Dash attack feels interesting, burning is expecting the landing to have a hitbox
- Bair might be a bit strong, a lot of moves feel very workshoppy powerful
- Maybe don't reward double jump off trampolines
- There's some odd behavior with tethered cpus but I don't think that's an issue
- OH MY GOD ADD TURNAROUND :(
- Neutral B feels weird bc of how shorthopping it feels
- You can't tap rapid jab to keep it going
- Too much endlag on dair maybe
- Jab combos into jab (oh no)
- Infinite wall climb would be a bit much, maybe turn down the extended wall climb time
- You can dangle near the bottom of the stage! It is unpunishable! FIX THIS!!!!
- Fstrong sweetspot might need an angle lift, maybe sakurai angle?
- You can fastfall up special (This is cool, actually)
- Wavedash speed is slower than running (Unsure on this one)
- A lot of people don't seem to be reading the opponent teching on the trampoline, maybe play the sound effect when teching or add a visual

- From burnign: fstrong is too brutal, i think the projectile if you are going to have it do 1% should force flinch not enter hitstun and increase the damage of the projectile, side special forces tech and dstrong covers 2 options so it might be a bit over tuned
- Side special hitbox shouldn't work when returning after being hit
- Down strong is REALLY fuckin good, both players seem to use it a lot near the ledge, the strat against it seems to be avoiding it rather than aiming to punish it
- Fspecial seems to struggle at pulling people in, it slides them along the ground, which can force a tech
- Up tilt hitbox is jank (I agree!!!)
- More cooldown on Fspecial

- Up tilt scoop is pretty good
- Fstrong killed kragg at like, 60 with weird DI
- More whifflag might be needed on nair, fair
- Landing a parry should untether you (QOL)

- Up special has some sick tech when you hitfall the orb
