- Dash attack feels interesting, burning is expecting the landing to have a hitbox
- You can't tap rapid jab to keep it going

- Side special hitbox shouldn't work when returning after being hit
- Fspecial seems to struggle at pulling people in, it slides them along the ground, which can force a tech
- Up tilt hitbox is jank (I agree!!!)

- Up tilt scoop is pretty good
- More whifflag might be needed on nair, fair
- Landing a parry should untether you (QOL)

- Up special has some sick tech when you hitfall the orb

- BUGS!
    - Hitting a projectile while in dspecial tethers the opponent (check the attack of the HITBOX, not the PLAYER)
    - Breaking a trampoline while a projectile's inside will leave the projectile there for a bit

- TODOS!
    - Uspecial should have a real hitbox
    - Hurtboxes need to match the animations a bit more
    - Wall attacks should have proper hurtboxes

    - Parry web should be BIG! Bold! Have them FLICK it out rather than hold onto it
    - Fstrong should charge with archarid crossing their arms, and they should FLICK the web behind them as they LUNGE forward

    - If I get the time, let's do some bigger normal vfx, they're fun :3

    - Wall air needs an identity
    - Up tilt needs an animation overhaul
    - Fair needs an identity
    - Fstrong needs an animation overhaul
    - PLEASE fix up strong it fucking sucks

    - Add an indicator for offstage web points
